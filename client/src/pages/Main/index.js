						&emsp;&emsp; This is a project I have made with the help of some of my fellow classmates and the Teacher's Assistants in the UCF Coding Bootcamp.
						The purpose of this page is to facilitate the connection between people of around the world by making it easier to learn the different languages. 
						We want you to feel comfortable learning and reach your goal at your own pace. 
						With the low price of free you can enjoy the page to the fullest and comical with other people in your native language even if they donâ€™t speak it. 
						All thanks to the Watson being the brains of our translator. 
						Please enjoy and leave us any feedback for what we can do to improve.
